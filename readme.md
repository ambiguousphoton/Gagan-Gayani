Creating a simulation of the first four planets in the solar system (Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars) with accurate physics using pygame can be an exciting project. Below, I'll outline the steps to build such a simulation:

Set up the environment:

Install pygame: Make sure you have pygame installed on your system. You can install it using pip: pip install pygame.
Define constants:

Gather the necessary data for each planet, such as their mass, radius, initial position, and velocity.
Set up constants like gravitational constant (G) and time step (dt) for the simulation.
Create the Planet class:

Create a class to represent each planet with attributes like mass, radius, position, velocity, and color.
Implement a method to update the planet's position and velocity based on gravitational forces from other planets.
Implement the main simulation loop:

Initialize pygame and set up the screen.
Create instances of the Planet class for each planet.
Inside the main loop, calculate the gravitational forces acting on each planet from the other planets and update their positions and velocities accordingly.
Draw the planets on the screen at their updated positions.
Implement accurate physics:

Use Newton's law of universal gravitation to calculate the force between each pair of planets.
Use numerical integration methods like Euler's method or Verlet integration to update the positions and velocities of the planets.
